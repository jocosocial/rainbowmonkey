## Privacy Policy

This application collects data you enter in the application
and transmits it to the
Twitarr server. Additionally, it regularly contacts the
Twitarr server to get updates, and these requests include
credentials you entered.

For details on the Twitarr server, see: https://github.com/seamonkeysocial/twitarr

When you register an account you must provide a code. This code
identifies you (it is associated with your JoCo cruise account).
Actions you take while logged in can therefore be associated
with you.

Some data, such as your username and password, is stored locally
on your device for your convenience.

Beyond this, no data is collected by this application.
