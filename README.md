## Updating the Karaoke list

Make sure that the `resources/JoCoKaraokeSongCatalog.txt` file is in
UTF-8. The original file was in Mac OS Roman; to convert from that to
UTF-8, you can use this command:

```bash
uconv --from-code mac --to-code utf8 --output converted.txt JoCoKaraokeSongCatalog.txt
```

You may also need to replace U+000D characters with U+000A characters.
